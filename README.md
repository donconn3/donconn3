### Hello There 

Digital Content Specialist is the game and Don is my name . . . wait, reverse that.

My current role has given me incredible experience in retail marketing, content creation, and email campaign building. After going through Tech Elevator (bootcamp) and their Fullstck Java Program, I have developed internal tools for myself and my peers to help with analaytics, email campaigns, and contests. I am looking forward to roles where I can continue to grow my skills in marketing and web development.
