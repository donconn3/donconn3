### Hello There 

Don is my name Digital Content Strategy is my game . .  . for now!

My current role has given me incredible experience in retail marketing, content creation, and email campaign building. After going through Tech Elevator (bootcamp) and their Fullstack Java Program, I have developed internal tools for myself and my peers to help with analaytics, email campaigns, and contests. I am looking forward to roles where I can continue to grow my skills in marketing and web development/software development.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Raffle program and Email Template Builder.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continuing to learn more about Javascript and Java.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in the Front-End or Back-End space.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my goals for the future!
